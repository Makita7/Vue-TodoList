### What I learned

While working on this project I learned how to use Vue Draggable and put in practice JS inside of Vue Js enviorment which was something that I hadn't done to this extent absolute
Also I learned how to emit events from child components and how to pass props down from parent components.

### Continued development

I want to continue to grow as a frontend developer practicing with real life projects to grow and be able to show what I can do.
